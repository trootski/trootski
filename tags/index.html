I think the crux of the issue is a difference between the latest driver available and the best driver for a machine.
The details are that the laptop is an Acer Aspire V5-122P. It is a cheap and cheerful laptop that I purchased for the following reasons:
Backup machine in case my daily driver broke down, Low powered machine to test performance of websites, Laptop I could take travelling without undue stress as to it&rsquo;s wellbeing.</div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><a href=http://localhost:1313/post/2014/01/new-rig/ class="image featured"><img src=2014_01_15_1443.png></a><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=http://localhost:1313/post/2014/01/new-rig/ class="link black dim">New Rig</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">As a sort of follow up to the article here I decided to continue to attempt to scratch my Linux itch.
Reasoning that maybe virtual machines aren&rsquo;t a fair reflection of a system&rsquo;s capabilities I went and bought a little netbook. I went for a little Acer Aspire in the January sales. This is a relatively cheap model, but it was the Christmas break so I had a little bit of time to kill.</div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><a href=http://localhost:1313/post/2013/09/ssd-upgrade-macbook-pro/ class="image featured"><img src=samsung-840-evo-ssd-1tb-2.jpg></a><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=http://localhost:1313/post/2013/09/ssd-upgrade-macbook-pro/ class="link black dim">SSD upgrade MacBook Pro</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Tutorials I recently updated my hard drive on my MacBook Pro to an SSD drive.

Taking hard drives out of mac books is actually relatively painless. It merely involves 3 screws, a likkle screwdriver and an L-plate behind the battery. A little external hard drive case (nicely provided by Darran) can save a lot of bother. Simply remove the hard drive, insert it into the case, plug into another computer and with any luck your hard drive is up and running</div></div></div><h2 class=f1><a href=/tags/personal class="link blue hover-black">Tag: personal</a></h2><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><a href=http://localhost:1313/post/2011/11/bess-has-pups/ class="image featured"><img src=img_0189-e1323172485851.jpg></a><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=http://localhost:1313/post/2011/11/bess-has-pups/ class="link black dim">Bess has pups</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Quick update on Bess, she has now entered the stage of life of motherhood.

I had ignored them for a long time but after a brief period sitting and learning a few I no longer missed vi mode. Some of the key reasons that prompted me to change are:
vi mode does not have a visual prompt, leading to unecassary escape smashing I only used the most basic motion command, eschewing a lot of the power of the vi commands When ssh&rsquo;ing into other boxes the switch in interface is jarring.</div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><a href=http://localhost:1313/post/2018/02/delete-last-word/ class="image featured"><img src=keyboard-w-alt-backspace.png></a><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=http://localhost:1313/post/2018/02/delete-last-word/ class="link black dim">Delete last word</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Coming from vim I´m used to a wide variety of keystrokes to manipulate text.

It&rsquo;s a really nice paradigm for working with when programming. It uses the same style of keyboard navigation as vim for moving around your windows.
The windows key can be bound as your modifier key and then used to navigate to a particular workspace (e.g. Windows + 2 to go to the browser workspace).
