Have to say, it really is a neat mix of the kinda power and libraries I&amp;rsquo;m used to with Perl and the flexibility of a pure scripting language.
Just for a giggle, I decided to re-write my C# backup script to backup some of my mac folders. Most of the language I&amp;rsquo;m still getting my head around. 4 times out of ten, each line gets a semi-colon.</description></item><item><title>Daily filing</title><link>http://localhost:1313/post/2009/08/daily-filing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/post/2009/08/daily-filing/</guid><description>A few years ago I was in my Boss' office in Interactve Services. He was showing me something on his computer, and I saw that his filing system was a system of folders named according to the date. So he never had a build up of files in one particular place.
I took this system on-board and modified it to my needs, and just thought I&amp;rsquo;d share it here. I have a folder on the desktop called &amp;ldquo;_today&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
